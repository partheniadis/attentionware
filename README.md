attentionware is a team project for interaction engineering in Masters in Digital Design, Hogeschool van Amsterdam. All credits go to the team Genevieve, Jouke, Pinar, Monica, Konstantinos.

There are two different Arduino sketches, one for the module located near the toilets and one for the module located on the white wall. The only differences are the sonar values for detecting human presence. The rest of the code is dientical.

Thanks!
